Title: Virtual package for classes and generics for working with Documents
Description: In this package, Documents are considered one or multi-page containers for text
  and we are primarily focusing on PDF and scanned (OCR'ed) documents. We don't exclude
  Word, OpenOffice, Pages and other forms of word processing documents, or diagrams
  or even spreadsheets (although these have much richer structure).
