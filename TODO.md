# TODO

- Finish bringing in general functions for identifing elements from
  other packages

- Decide to what extent we would like to update/improve the old
  functions
  
  - e.g., the footer and header functions depend on finding lines,
	which are not present in many documents.
	  
- expand tests

- write documentation
